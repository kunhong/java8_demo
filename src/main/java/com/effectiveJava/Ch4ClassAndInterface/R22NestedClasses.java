* nonstatic member classes
Each instance of a nonstatic member class is implicitly associated with an enclosing instance of its containing class
You can invoke methods on the enclosing instance or obtain a refer- ence to the enclosing instance using the qualified this construct
The association between a nonstatic member class instance and its enclosing instance is established when the former is created
The association takes up space in the nonstatic member class instance and adds time to its construction
i.e One common use of a nonstatic member class is to define an Adapter
